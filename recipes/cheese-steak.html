        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Philly cheese-steaks are iconicâ€”and for good reason. This is my version of the sandwich, which satisfies my cravings every time.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 peppers (a variety of colours), thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 large red onion, sliced</li>
            <li>700 g sirloin steak, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 baguettes</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Mustard</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add peppers and onion and season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until caramelised, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove onions and peppers from pan and set aside. Add remaining tablespoon oil and cook steak until it has almost reached your preferred doneness, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, pepper and a healthy dose of mustard.</li>
            <li>Return vegetables to pan and toss to combine with steak.</li>
            <li>Lightly toast the baguettes in your oven</li>
            <li>Grate cheese over mixture and cook, covered until the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Divide mixture among baguettes and serve.</li>
        </ol>
